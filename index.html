        <p>Hello! My name is Lonny Le, and I am a current Year Up and Seattle Central student, studying in the Software App Development track.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am an Amazon flex associate at an Amazon Return store, where I work primarily on customer servicing, inventory, and troubleshooting for those that need help. With my past few years of work-related experiences, I have gained a lot in customer servicing and how to assist those in any situation to make them relaxed and comfortable. Right now, I have dreams of wanting to develop software that will benefit those to make them eased as well. I will be able to do that by becoming a software engineer, with my foot already being in the door through the Year Up program, with all that I am currently learning. With my perseverance and dedication, I can be someone that can be relied upon in any circumstances.</p>

        <p>Feel free to check out my progress through my staging area, my projects, and my media to reach me listed up above in the navigation!</p>
